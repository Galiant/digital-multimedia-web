      <p>
        <strong>1.3</strong> Content includes all text, graphics, music or sounds, all messages or items of information, fictional characters, names, themes, objects, scenery, costumes, effects, dialogues, slogans, places, characters, diagrams, concepts, choreographies, videos, audio-visual effects, domain names and any other elements which are part of the Services, individually or in combination, together with all related Intellectual Property Rights in the above, (collectively, the "

      <h2>2. ACCOUNT</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>2.1</strong> Creation of Your Account.</p>
      <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
        <li>
          <p>Access to and use of certain additional functions and/or benefits of the Services are subject to the creation of an account with PTC (an "
            <strong>Account</strong>"). If you do not have an Account, you can create one on
            <a href="http://www.PTC.com/">http://www.PTC.com</a> or on
            <a href="http://www.uplay.com">http://www.uplay.com</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>To create an Account, you must have an e-mail address and supply accurate complete and up-to-date information. You must be authorised to use the Services for which you register, and in particular meet the age criteria.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Certain Services may require the creation of a username or an avatar and they will be linked to your Account and that will be publicly displayed. We therefore advise you not to include your surname in your username. For other information that may be publicly displayed, please refer to our Privacy Policy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>You may not:</p>
          <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
            <li>
              <p>select or use a username or an avatar which is already used by someone else or associated with another Account; or</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>select or use a username or avatar which does not meet the requirements of these Terms, in particular the rules of conduct set out in Article 3.2 and the Content standards set out in Article 3.3.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>create multiple accounts, except if this is specifically allowed with the Service by PTC. In such case, you acknowledge that you will close your additional Account upon PTC’s request. PTC advises you not to include your surname in your User name.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you choose, or you are provided with, a username, password or any other piece of information as part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential, and you must not disclose it to any third party. We will never ask you to reveal your password and will never initiate contact with you to ask you for the memory joggers associated with your password. Any use, in particular any purchase of Services, using your Account with your password will be deemed to be carried out by you. We have the right to disable any username or password if in our sole opinion you have failed to comply with any of the provisions of these Terms.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>2.2</strong> Accuracy and Use of Your Account Data.</p>
      <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
        <li>
          <p>You agree to supply and keep the personal information relating to your Account accurate, complete and up-to-date (including in the event of a transfer of data from a pre-existing Account).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>You shall not claim to be any other person or entity and shall not represent your identity or an affiliation with any other person or entity in an inaccurate way, including by using the username, password or any other information relating to someone else’s Account or the name, likeness, voice, image or photograph of another person or by providing false information concerning a parent or legal guardian when the registration process asks you to give this information.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>We may take action to check the accuracy of the information you give, including by checking landline or mobile telephone numbers and/or e-mail address you have given for you or a parent or legal guardian when applicable. In order to protect minors, other Users and prevent risks of fraud, you agree to send the necessary authorisations and supporting documents to PTC on request by e-mail, fax or post. The documents requested may include a copy of your national identity card or your passport.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>You also agree to inform PTC as quickly as possible at emea-email-support@PTC.com of any unauthorised use of your username, password or other information concerning your Account or of any other security violation concerning or involving the Services which comes to your attention.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>4.1</strong> If you are a minor, you should read these Terms with the help of your parents or guardians.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.2</strong> If you are a parent or guardian, PTC recommends that you monitor your children’s online activities and check that your children never disclose their personal data without your prior consent.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.3</strong> We may restrict access to certain Services on age grounds. For such Services,we ask for a parent or guardian’s approval when a child under 12 years old (a "
        <strong>Minor</strong>") wishes to use the Services made available to Minors. When a Minor registers, they must supply the e-mail address of a parent or legal guardian who we will contact to confirm, refuse or modify their child’s access to Services. PTC reserves the right to limit the period during which a Minor may play pending confirmation and activation by their parent or guardian.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.4</strong> We reserve the right to ask for written proof of consent from a parent or guardian for any User or potential User of the Services we suspect is a Minor. Parental consent applies exclusively to the Service for which it has been granted.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.5</strong> Certain Services are specially designed for children and enable children to create their own free Account for which PTC collects their username, password, date of birth (or age), country and parent or guardian’s e-mail address.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.6</strong> Such Services sometimes offer the possibility of paying for a subscription or certain game functions which enable children to participate in more activities on the Services. The subscription services may also allow parents or guardians to manage their children’s account and create their own new player Account.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.7</strong> Certain Services enable children to create personalised avatars which they can use across the Services, including mini-games and virtual worlds. Children may also use other functions of the Services such as "recommend to a friend" to invite a friend to find out about the Services. Invitation functions enable children to send their friends a single message inviting them to visit the related Service. We will collect the first name and e-mail address of your child (or, failing that, the e-mail address of the parent or guardian) and the e-mail address of their friend for the sole purpose of sending a single message. This information is neither stored nor used for any other purpose and we do not reveal your child’s e-mail address to the recipient.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.8</strong> Certain Services enable children to receive newsletters. Minors with access to a forum will be able to see other Users’ messages in the forum. On certain forums PTC may operate a ‘safe chat’ system which either filters words and set phrases which we consider unacceptable for Minors, or limits submissions to a list of predefined phrases. This aims to reduce content of a hurtful or insulting nature. When a forum Service is available, "report abuse" links are provided.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.9</strong> Parents or guardians may de-activate their child’s account at any time by creating a parental account or by sending an e-mail to the administrator of the Privacy Policy, whose contact details are given in the Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.10</strong> In all cases, all use of the Services by Minors is the responsibility of their parents or legal guardians whom we assume approve their use of the Services and agree to these Terms.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.11</strong> As far as is permitted by law, PTC accepts no responsibility regarding any activities which may be conducted by minors without the permission of their parents or legal guardians. If you are a parent or legal guardian and you give your permission for your child to resister for one or other of the services, you thereby agree to the Terms relating to use of the Services by your child. Please consult our Privacy Policy available on legal.PTC.com for further details.</p>
